# EcholinkPi
This will holed the source code for the Echo-link Shield board for Raspberry Pi 2
<b>Requirements for this project</b>
1) This repository will have the details of a PCB and Software for a Echolink comunication Board with a build in VHF or UHF trancever.<br>
2) This PCB will use the internal Serial interface of the Raspberry PI 2 P5 connector to controle the trancever.<br>
3) The purpose of this board is to generate a VHF / UHF hotspot with [SVXLink] Echolink software on a Raspberry PI 2.<br>
4) This PCB  will be designed by Kicad with on board VHF and UHF transceivers.<br>
5) PCB will be developed with maximum SMD components for automated assembly and reduce cost.<br>
