# EcholinkPi
This will holed the source code for the Echo-link Shield board for Raspberry Pi 2<br>
This PCB will be used by Radio Amateurs to create a local hotspot Link to Echolink. (Ham license required)<br>
<b>Requirements for this project</b><br>
1) This repository will have the details of a PCB and Software for a Echolink comunication PCB with a build in VHF or UHF trancever.<br>
2) This PCB will use the internal Serial interface of the Raspberry PI 2 P5 connector to controle the trancever.<br>
3) The purpose of this board is to generate a VHF / UHF hotspot with [SVXLink] Echolink software on a Raspberry PI 2.<br>
4) This PCB will be designed by Kicad<br>
5) PCB will be developed with SMD components for automated assembly and to reduce cost on construktion.<br>
